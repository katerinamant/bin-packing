In order to run the project, follow these steps.

To run the greedy aglorithm that solves the bin packing problem without sorting the disks first, run the commands:

1. 'cd src'
2. 'javac bin_packing/Greedy.java'
3. 'java bin_packing.Greedy ../input.txt'

To run the experiment comparing the above algorithm with one that firsts sorts the disks in a decreasing order, run the commands:

1. 'cd src'
2. 'javac experiment/Experiment.java'
3. 'java experiment.Experiment 3 100 200 500' (where the first number is the
    number of test cases and each number after it is the number of disks
    generated for that test case)

The project has been tested and works both on UNIX-based and Windows systems.
